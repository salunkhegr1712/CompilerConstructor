0001 A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre. Equivalently, 
0002 it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant. 
0003 The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the radius. Usually, the radius is required to be a positive number.
0004 A circle with {\displaystyle r=0}r=0 is a degenerate case. This article is about circles in Euclidean geometry, and, in particular, 
0005 the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.
0006 Specifically, a circle is a simple closed curve that divides the plane into two regions: an interior and an exterior. In everyday use, 
0007 the term "circle" may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to the whole figure including its interior;
0008  in strict technical usage, the circle is only the boundary and the whole figure is called a disc.
0009 A circle may also be defined as a special kind of ellipse in which the two foci are coincident, the eccentricity is 0, 
0010 and the semi-major and semi-minor axes are equal; or the two-dimensional shape enclosing the most area per unit perimeter squared, 
0011 using calculus of variations.
0012 Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific main point. Whereas
0013  the thesis is the main point of the essay, the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph. Like the thesis statement, 
0014  a topic sentence has a unifying function. But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity. An essay is 
0015  unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence. 
0016  Note: Not all paragraphs need topic sentences. In particular, opening and closing paragraphs, which serve different functions from
0017   body paragraphs, generally don’t have topic sentences.
0018 In academic writing, the topic sentence nearly always works best at the beginning of a paragraph so that the reader knows what to expect:
0019 The embrace of Twitter by politicians and journalists has been one of its most notable features in recent years: for both groups the use of Twitter is becoming close to a requirement.
0020 —Paul Bernal, “A Defence of Responsible Tweeting”
0021 This topic sentence forecasts the central idea or main point of the paragraph: “politicians” and “journalists” rely on Twitter. 
0022 The rest of the paragraph will focus on these two Twitter-user groups, thereby fulfilling the promise made by the topic sentence. By avoiding irrelevant information that does not relate to the topic sentence, you can compose a unified paragraph.
0023 How do I develop my ideas in a paragraph?
0024 Often, the body paragraph demonstrates and develops your topic sentence through an ordered, logical progression of ideas. There are a number 
0025 of useful techniques for expanding on topic sentences and developing your ideas in a paragraph. 
0026 Illustration in a paragraph supports a general statement by means of examples, details, or relevant quotations (with your comments).
0027 In Harry’s world fate works not only through powers and objects such as prophecies, the Sorting Hat, wands, and the Goblet of Fire, but also through people. Repeatedly, other characters decide Harry’s future for him, depriving him of freedom and choice.
0028 For example, before his eleventh birthday, the Dursleys control Harry’s life, keeping from him knowledge of his past and understanding of his identity (Sorcerer’s 49). 
0029 In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Dobby repeatedly assumes control over events by intercepting Ron’s and Hermione’s letters during the summer; 
0030 by sealing the barrier to Platform 93⁄4, causing Harry to miss the Hogwarts Express; and by sending a Bludger after Harry in a Quidditch match,
0031 breaking his wrist. Yet again, in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, many adults intercede while attempting to protect Harry from perceived danger,
0032 as Snape observes: “Everyone from the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black” (284). All these characters, as enactors of fate, unknowingly drive Harry toward his destiny 
0033 by attempting to control or to direct his life, while themselves controlled and directed by fate.
0034 Julia Pond, “A Story of the Exceptional: Fate and Free Will in the Harry Potter Series”
0035 The definition paragraph does exactly what you would expect: it defines a term, often by drawing distinctions between the term and other related ones. 
0036 The definition that you provide will often be specific to your subject area. Try to avoid perfunctory dictionary definitions that do not inform your 
0037 analysis in a meaningful way.
0038 Our typology is built on three dimensions: internality, types of participants, and the degree of effective resistance. For our study, a civil war is a
0039 ny armed conflict that involves (a) military action internal to the metropole, (b) the active participation of the national government,
0040 and (c) effective resistance by both sides. With these criteria, we differentiate civil wars from other types of internal violent conflicts.
0041 Melvin Small and J. David Singer, Resort to Arms: International and Civil Wars, 1816–1980
0042 The analysis or classification paragraph develops a topic by distinguishing its component parts and discussing each of these parts separately.
0043 Policies of privatisation should be considered as responses to several distinct pressures. First, privatisation is a response 
0044 by the state to internal forces such as increasing fiscal problems (O’Connor, 1973). It provides a means of lessening the state’s fiscal responsibilities
0045 by encouraging the development of private alternatives which, theoretically at least, do not draw upon the state’s financial reserves.
0046 Second, the promotion of private sector activity is a response to pressures originating ‘outside’ the state apparatus. These include 
0047 demands from people who see a large state bureaucracy as inefficient and wasteful, demands from business interests who claim that 
0048 they can overcome these inefficiencies, and pressures from client groups who seek to reduce their dependency on the welfare state by
0049 having more control over the services on which they depend. Clearly, 
0050 this variety of calls for privatisation means that it is not a process with a uniform outcome; there exists a correspondingly 
0051 wide variety of forms of privatisation.
0052 —Adapted from Glenda Laws, “Privatisation and the Local Welfare State”
0053 A comparison or a contrast paragraph zeroes in on a key similarity or difference between, for instance, two sources, positions, or ideas.
0054 Decide whether to deal only with similarities or only with differences, or to cover both. Also, keep in mind that a single comparison can
0055 be spread out over two separate paragraphs.
0056 As the following topic sentence indicates, you should make your intention clear to readers from the outset.
0057 Evidence from industrialized countries suggests that compared with older men, older women more often experience functional impairments and activity limitations, 
0058 have longer durations of disability, and spend proportionately more remaining years of life disabled.
0059 —Kathryn M. Yount, “Differences in Disability among Older Women in Egypt and Tunisia”
0060 A qualification paragraph acknowledges that what you previously asserted is not absolutely true or always applicable.
0061 This study was a preliminary study of high school student value changes because of the terrorist attack on the U.S.
0062  The major limitations of this study were that the student population was from California and might not truly represent
0063 all high school students in the U.S. Further, this study could not be considered a truly longitudinal study because of 
0064 privacy issues that prevented the researchers from identifying all the students who returned surveys before the attack.
0065    In addition, the senior class had graduated the previous year, and a much larger freshman class entered the school.
0066 These issues not only made the samples similar, but also different in their composition. The researchers will conduct 
0067 periodic studies to explore whether these value changes are permanent and continue into adulthood. We do not know what if
0068 any changes will take place in their values 
0069 as they grow older, and we will continue to explore their values in our longitudinal studies of the impact of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
0070 —Edward F. Murphy, et al., “9/11 Impact on Teenage Values”
0071 The process paragraph involves a straightforward step-by-step description. Process description often follows a chronological sequence.
0072 In brief, the mummification process may be summarized as follows: extract, sterilize, dehydrate, perfume, seal, tag, and stock. 
0073 All were done ceremoniously and with due respect to the dead body. The viscera were extracted through an incision about 10 inches long,
0074  usually made in the left side of the abdomen. Through this incision, all the “floating” contents of the abdominal cavity, namely, the stomach,
0075 the liver, the spleen, and the intestines, were removed but the kidneys were left in place. The diaphragm was then cut and the thoracic contents 
0076 removed through the abdominal incision. The heart, which was considered the center of emotions and the seat of conscience, was left in place.
0077 The ancient Egyptians seem to have attached no importance to the brain, which was removed through the ethmoid bone. Following these extractions 
0078 began the slow process of sterilization and dehydration of the body, accomplished by osmosis with dry natron. Resterilization of the cavities,
0079 perfuming, closing the incision, and wrapping the body with linen and with beeswax completed the process. Molten resin was used to seal the 
0080 body and its wrappings, providing a barrier against insects and anaerobes.
